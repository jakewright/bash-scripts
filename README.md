A collection of useful aliases and functions to source from your bash profile.

To use these scripts, clone the repository:

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:jakewright/bash-scripts.git
```

Then add the following to `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
source ~/bash-scripts/git.sh
source ~/bash-scripts/web.sh
```

Reload your bash profile by running `source ~/.bash_profile`.

Feel free to clone the repository to a different directory, just update the paths that you source as appropriate.
